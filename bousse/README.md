## Description

Our artifact folder is divided in two folders:

- `framework-sources` is the main part of the artifact submission, and contains all the sources used to build a complete GEMOC studio, which includes the sources of the GEMOC execution framework. The README explains both which parts of the sources are related to which parts of the framework described in the paper, and how to compile a working studio using the sources (which is optionnal since we provide a working studio, see next point).
- `gemoc-studio` contains an archive with a complete GEMOC Studio. The README explains how to start and play with a GEMOC Studio for each of the presented execution engines.
