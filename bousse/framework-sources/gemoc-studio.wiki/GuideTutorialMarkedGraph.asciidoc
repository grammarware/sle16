= Tutorial: Make Marked Graph models executable with the GEMOC Studio

// old title: Animate Marked Graph Models with the GEMOC Studio


== What is expected at the end of this tutorial

This tutorial aims at demonstrating the power of the GEMOC studio to
define an executable semantics and provide graphical animation for a
DSML.   It relies of the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marked_graph[marked graph] language.

The link:MarkedGraph/images/MarkedGraph-wikipedia-anim-all.gif[following animation] shows the expecting results of this tutorial:
according to the fired transitions, tokens move from place to place.

== Install the projects defining the Marked Graph AS and CS

The domain model is implemented with several EMF projects that you
need to import into your workspace.
A graphical editor defined with Sirius is also available to visualize
// and edit	TODO: to be added?
Marked Graph models.

////
TODO: If you are using the GEMOC Studio, you can find these projects
from the provided examples (menu File > New > Example... : select
Marked Graph DSML Definition). 
////

=== Import the Marked Graph AS and CS

Download the
link:MarkedGraph/org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.zip[provided
archive] containing the projects and unzip it.  Then, with the GEMOC
Studio, select __import... / General / Existing Projects into
Workspace__ and import all the projects from the archive file.

containing all the projects] that will be created during this tutorial.


=== Abstract Syntax

Marked Graph is a kind of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net[Petri net]
in which every place has exactly one incoming arc and exactly one
outgoing arc.  As a consequence, it a concurrent language (several
transitions may be fired) and has no conflict.

The Domain Model, also called Abstract Syntax or Metamodel, defines :

- A __marked graph__ as a set of __places__ and __transitions__.
- Each __Place__ has exactly one __input__ transition and one __output__
transition and a token count.
- A transition has several __input__ places and several __output__
  places.

// [[MarkedGraph-AS]]
.Abstract Syntax (Metamodel) of MarkedGraph
image::MarkedGraph/images/MarkedGraph-AS.png[MarkedGraph Domain Model (Metamodel)]

=== Concrete Syntax and Sample Model

The graphical concrete syntax draws places as
circles and transitions as squares.  Inputs and outputs of places and
transitions are designated by arrows.  The following picture shows the
graphical representation of the
link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marked_graph[Marked Graph model of wikipedia]
(using a graphical syntax defined using
link:http://www.eclipse.org/sirius/[Sirius]).

.Example of a Marked Graph model (from link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marked_graph[wikipedia])
image::MarkedGraph/images/MG-model-wikipedia.png[Example of a Marked Graph model (from wikipedia)]

== Set up an xDSML project

In this section, we first create an xDSML project for MarkedGraph
and initialize it with the provided Abstract Syntax (AS) and Concrete
Syntax (CS).

First, check that the current perspective is "xDSML" (top right of Eclipse
frame).  The perspective can be changed thanks to the menu "Window > Open Perspective > Others".

=== Create an xDSML Project

Create a "New  xDSML project" (__New > Project > GEMOC
Project / new GEMOC Concurrent xDSML Project__).
////
You can also select __New ... / GEMOC Concurrent xDSML Project__.
////

.Create a GEMOC Concurrent xDSML Project
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-06b-xdsml-GEMOC-concurrent.png[Create a GEMOC Concurrent xDSML Project, 800]

The first dialog of the wizard asks for the name of the project. Define
it as __org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.xdsml__.


.Define the name of the project
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-07-xdsml-define-name.png[Define the name of the project, 800]

Click on __Next__  and define the properties of the language (__markedgraph__).
The 'Package' property is already defined (based on the project name).
The othe properties include the name of melange file (used to link together the
different parts on an xDSML), the name of the language and the location of the
Ecore file.  The two other properties 'DSA projects' and 'ECL path' will be
created latter in this tutorial.

Use 'markedgraph' for the Melange file name, 'MarkedGraphL' for the Language
name and select the markedgraph.ecore file by Browsing the
'org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.model' project (found in 'model' directory).


.Define the properties of the xDSML
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-09-xdsml-wizard-complete.png[Define the properties of the xDSML, 800] 




=== Open the Melange file

The Melange file summarizes all the important resources used in an xDSML
project (which are part of and managed by other projects). Completion
(CTRL-SPACE) can be used to launch wizard but it will not be used in this
tutorial.  The Melange file is found in the
'org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.xdsml'  project in the 'src' directory.

== Define the Execution Semantics

// === Execution Semantics Overview

// XXX: à déplacer dans MoCC ou DSE ?

A transition can be fired if there is at least one token in every of
each input place.  When a transition is fired, one token is removed from each
of its input places and one token is added to each of its output places.
Several transitions can be fired as the same time.

Defining the execution semantics consists in implementing the previous
behavior.  In the GEMOC approach, it is split in different concerns:

* The definition of Execution Data (ED) like the runtime count of
tokens in a place and Execution Functions (EF) like fire a transition.
ED and EF constitute **the DSA**.

* The definition of the model of concurrency as a set of events and
constraints on these events.  It is **the MoCC** concern that is
defined in a DSE project (using ECL, Event Constraint Language)
possibly completed with MoCCML projects  to define libraries of
constraints.

* The **mapping** between the DSA and the MoCC.

In the current version of the GEMOC studio, the MoCC and the mapping
are tightly coupled and described in ECL (Event Constraint Language).



=== Define DSA

During execution of a MarkedGraph, the number of tokens of a place has
to be recorded and changed according to the fired transitions.  Thus,
we have to manage an execution data (ED) called runtimeTokenCount and
an execution function (EF) on Transition called fire().  Furthermore,
the runtimeTokenCount of each place must be initialized at the start
of the execution. It is the purpose of the EF called initialize() on
the MarkedGraph element.

The DSA of Marked Graph is composed of :

* one ED called  __runtimeTokenCount__
defined on __Place__ . It represents the number of token in a place when the
model is executed.
* one EF called initialize() defined
on __MarkedGraph__. It initializes the runtime token count of each
place with the initial token count.
* one ED called __fire()__ on
__Transition__. It to remove one token from each of its input places
and add one token to all its output places.


==== Extend the AS with ED and EF

At the moment, we need to complete the AS (markedgraph.ecore) with the
ED and EF.  In the next release of the GEMOC Studio this step replaced by the
use of link:http://melange-lang.org/[Melange] to automatically extend the AS
with ED and EF.
// XXX : Possible ?

The ED and EF are already defined on the provided metamodel.  Thus, there
is no need to add the 'runtimeTokenCount' ED on Place, 'fire()' on Transition
and 'initialize()' on MarkedGraph.

.Abstract Syntax of MarkedGraph extended with Execution Data (ED) and Execution Functions (EF)
image::MarkedGraph/images/MarkedGraph-AS-DSA.png[Abstract Syntax of MarkedGraph extended with Execution Data (ED) and Execution Functions (EF)]


==== Create the DSA Project

In the Project Explorer, right click on any file of the xDSML project and
choose __GEMOC Languge > Create DSA Project for language__ to start the wizard.

.Create a DSA Project
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-12b-dsa-new.png[Create a DSA Project, 800]

The wizard first add for the language: select 'MarkedGraphL' and click __OK__.
On the next screen, the project name is already initialized.  Click 'Finish'
and the 'org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.k3dsa' is created and the Melange file is completed with references to aspects implemented the ED and EF.

.The Melange file with references to aspects implementing ED and EF
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-15-melange-with-dsa.png[The Melange file with references to aspects implementing ED and EF, 800]


==== Implement the DSA

Open the __markedgraphAspects.xtend__ file.  It is located in the __org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.k3dsa__ project in __src/markedgraph.aspects__.
The file has been initialized with a template that can be discarded and
replaced with the link:MarkedGraph/markedgraphAspects.xtend[following text].

[source,k3]
----
include::MarkedGraph/markedgraphAspects.xtend[DSA defined using K3]
----


.Definition of the DSA (ED and EF)
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-18-dsa-file-completed.png[Definition of the DSA (ED and EF), 800]


There is an error in the Melange file because no aspect has been defined on the NamedElement metaclass.  Just comment out the corresponding line.

////
==== Create the Extented Model with Melange

Note: This step should become transparent in a next version of the
GEMOC Stutio.

XXX: What is the status of Melange.  How it works?

////


=== Define DSE

The purpose of the DSE project is to define events (called DSE) on AS
elements that will trigger EF calls when they occurs.  Furthermore,
constraints can be defined on these events to define when they may occur.
// XXX: wording must be improved?




==== Create the DSE Project

Like for the DSA Project, right click on any file of the xDSML project and
choose __GEMOC Languge > Create DSE Project for language__ to start the wizard.

.Create a DSE Project
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-19b-dse-new.png[Create a DSE Project, 800]


Then :

1. Select the MarkedGraphL language and click __OK__.
2. On the next screen of the wizard, click __Next__ (the project name is already initialized __org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.dse__).
3. On the last screen, complete the required fields:
    * The MarkedGraph Ecore file has already been initialized, just click on __Browse__.
    * Select the root container : MarkedGraph::MarkedGraph
    * Set the __New ECL file basename__ is already set to 'MarkedGraphL'


.Initializing the DSE project
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-24b-dse-wizard-completed.png[Initializing the DSE project, 800]


// XXX change the wizard

Once the wizard has been completed, the __org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.dse__
project is created with a template for the MarkedGraphL.ecl file (found in the
ecl directory).

.Template of the ECL file
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-25-dse-template.png[Template of the ECL file, 800]



// XXX To be updated

==== Define DSE

Replace the content of the ECL file with the
link:MarkedGraph/MarkedGraphL.ecl[following code] (explanations on
this code are given bellow):

[source,ecl]
.The file MarkedGraphL.ecl
----
include::MarkedGraph/MarkedGraphL.ecl[Definition of the MoCC]
----


.Definition of the DSE (events and constraints)
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-26-dse-completed.png[Definition of the DSE (events and constraints), 800]



This step has three main purposes:

1. First, it specifies DSE in the context of metaclasses of the AS.
For Marked Graph xDSML, we identify 2 DSE:

    - fireIt: defined in the context of a Transition
    - initIt: defined in the context of a MarkedGraph

2. Then, it links them to EF from DSA --- when a DSE will occur the
associated EF will be executed.

    - fireIt is linked to the EF 'fire' of Transition
    - initIt is linked to the EF 'initialize' of MarkedGraph

3. Finally, it defines constraints on the DSE to rule the possible
scheduling.  Constraints generally rely on relations which are defined
in MoCC libraries. Here constraints are expressed in CCSL and only relies
on relations and expression from the CCSL core library.

    - A first constraint applies on the fireIt events.  It is depends on
the number of token in a place.  Indeed, if there is no tokens, then
the fireIt of the output transition can only occur after the fireIt
event of the input transition has occured. It is expressed by the first
invariant defined in the context of a Place.
//
If there is some tokens in a place, then the fireIt event of the output
transition may occur as many times as there is tokens in this place.
After, it will only occur when the fireIt on the input transition of the
place has occured.  It is expressed using the DelayFor expression in the
second envariant of Place.

    - Two other constraints are defined in the context of the MarkedGraph
element.  The first one expresses that the first initIt event must occur
before any fireIt event.  The second one expresses that the initIt event
can occur only one time.

////
TODO: To be added as a next tutorial.
WARNING: Errors are present because the used Relations are not yet
defined...  They will be solved during the next step of this tutorial.
////


NOTE: Please notice that, as often, DSE are defined at the language
level, but at runtime they are instantiated as MSE on each object
instance of the metaclasse they are defined on.  For example, there will be
one fireIt MSE for each Transition element of MarkedGraph model.  For the
wikipedia example, there will a fireIt event for transitions t1, t2, t3 and
t4. In the same way, constraints apply to the MSE.


////
TODO: Separate the MoCC part.  We could define several relations :
onlyOnce, beforeAll, and delayedPrecede.

TODO: Say that the Precede relation is defined in kernel.ccslLib or
CCSL.ccslLib.
////




////
TODO: Add a link to another tutorial which uses an automata to define
the MoCC.

TODO:
Tricks: Limitation of ECL for Integer type : use of a local
expression.

== Execute a Model

The executable MarkedGraph Language is now defined.  We can use the
GEMOC Modeling Workbench to execute MarkedGraph models. In the next section, we
will see how to define a graphical animation a MarkedGraph model.

=== Launch the Modeling WorkBench

First, we will create a run configuration.  Select "run / run Configurations".

.Select "run / run Configurations"
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-50-animate-run-config.png[Select "run / run Configurations"]

Double click on "Eclipse Application" and change the name "New
Configuration" into "MarkedGraph Modeling Workbench".

.Define the Marked Graph Modeling Workbench configuration
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-51-animate-EclipseApplication-configuration.png[Define the Marked Graph Modeling Workbench configuration]

Then click "Run" to start the new runtime Eclipse which indeed corresponds to
the Modeling Workbench for MarkedGraph.


=== Import the project with a sample model

Import the modeling project
link:MarkedGraph/org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.sample.zip[org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.sample]
in the Modeling Workbench (Import / General / Existing project into
Workspace).  It contains the wikipedia.markedgraph file which corresponds
to the link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marked_graph[Wikipedia example].


.Importing the existing sample project from the archive file
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-54-animate-import-sample-project-2eclipse.png[Importing the existing sample project from the archive file, 800]


=== Select the Modeling perspective

* Select "Window / Open Perspective / Others...".  Alternatively, you can  click on the little icon on the right of "Quick Access" field, on the left on the current perspective (top right of the main frame).
* Select "Modeling" in the list.

.Select the 'Modeling' perspective
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-53-animate-perspective-select.png[Select the 'Modeling' perspective]


=== View the wikipedia example

To open the graphical visualization of the wikipedia MarkedGraph example,
double-click on wikipedia.aird resource, then open the tree view until
"wikipedia MarkeGraph diagram" appears. Open it.

.Open the Sirius graphical view of wikipedia example
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-55-animate-wikipedia-model-sirius.png[Open the Sirius graphical view of wikipedia example]

The properties view (bottom right) allow to see the properties on an element.
We can see that a place object has the "Runtime Token Count" properties (the
added ED).


=== Create a Launch Configuration

* Select __Debug / Debug Configurations__

.Select __Debug / Debug Configurations__
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-56-animate-debug-debug-configuration.png[Select __Debug / Debug Configurations__]

* Double click on "Gemoc Concurrent eXecutable Model"
* Change the name of the new configuration to "run wikipedia example"
* Browse to select the model to run (wikipedia.markedgraph)
* Select its language (xDSML field): org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.xdsml.MarkedGraphL
* Check that the "Decider" is set to "Step by step user decider" (the user
  will decide which well be the next step to execute).
* Click on "Debug"

.Define the configuration to run the wikipedia example
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-57-animate-debug-config-filled.png[Define the configuration to run the wikipedia example]


=== Launch the execution of the model

We can now run the "gemoc" configuration.


It selects the different views related to the execution on an xDSML model.

.The wikipedia model is just started
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-58-animate-debug.png[The wikipedia model is just started]

* **Logical Steps Decider** (top left): the list of the logical steps that may be
  selected at this execution step.  For each step, the trigerred MSE are
  displayed on the left and the associated EF on the right.  The stimuli
  manager can be used to stop the GEMOC engine, and thus the execution (red
  button).

.Logical Steps Decider
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-59-animate-debug-logical-steps-decider.png[Logical Steps Decider]

* **Stimuli Manager** (bottom left): the list of MSE.
* **Console** (bottom right): several consoles are available.  The displayed
one is the "Modeling Workbench Console" which reports that the GEMOC Execution
has benne started.  Change it to the "Default MessagingSystem Console" (click
on the arrow near the console symbol).  Clear it.

.Change the displayed console
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-60-animate-console-change.png[Change the displayed console]

* **Gemoc Engine Status** (with Stimuli Manager): the list on the running GEMOC
engines.  The red button stops the selected engine.

.Gemoc Engine Status
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-61-animate-gemoc-engine-status.png[Gemoc Engine Status]

As we have not yet defined any animation for the MarkedGraph Language, there will be no animation and the graphical visualization will not change.


=== Select a logical step

The Logical Steps view, presents the possible steps, and for each step,
the MSE that will occur if it is selected.

.Initial State
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-62-step-0.png[Initial State]

Double-click on a Logical Step to choose it.  The corresponding MSEs occur and
trigger the associated execution functions (EF) which make the state of the
model evolve.  Here, we will see traces in the Console are the EF we have
defined print messages.  The first MSE was __initIt__, which init the Graph and
all its places (by initializing the runtime token count with the token count).
The is then only one possible step: fireIt applied on t1 (__MSE_ta_fireIt).

.Execute a logical step (initIt)
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-62-step-1-init.png[Execute a logical step (initIt)]

Then, we can select a new logical step and so one.
In the following screenshots, we have first selected the t1 transition, and
then the t2 transition.

.Execute a logical step (t1 fired)
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-62-step-2-t1.png[Execute a logical step (t1 fired)]

.Execute a logical step (t2 fired)
image::MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-62-step-2-t1.png[Execute a logical step (t2 fired)]


=== Stop the execution

To stop the execution, simply click on the red button in the Logical Steps Decider view (or in the Gemoc Engines view).


=== How to visualize the state of the model?

It is now time to see how to graphically visualize the evolution on the
MarkedGraph model.  We can let the second eclipse running and go back to the
first one to complete the xDSML definition with the animation part.



== Define Animation Viewpoint


During the execution of a Marked Graph model, we want to visualize :

* the number of tokens in any place: the runtime token count will be printed in the circle of one place.
* the firable transitions: they will be drawn in green.

// and the size of the circle can be proportional to the number of tokens it
// contains.

As the animation view is close to the graphical concrete syntax, we
extend the existing diagram description.

First, we will define in the Language Workbench a graphical representation
based on the graphical Marked Graph syntax thanks to the wizard called "Create
Animator Project for language", in whichwe will add a layer to describe the
graphical animation of a Marked Graph model.

Then we will be to able to visualize the states of mobel being executed in the MarkedGraph Modeling Workbench.


=== Create a debug representation (as an extension of the graphical editor viewpoint)

Keep the MarkedGraph Modeling Workbenchrunning and come back to the Language
Workbench (first Gemoc Studio).

==== Run the wizard

Rigth-click on any file of the __org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.xdsml__ project and select __GEMOC Language > Create Animator Project for language__.

////
// Obsolete
==== Set the animation viewpoint in project.xml

In the xDSML editor, we can select the animation viewpoint by selecting the
newly created project (__org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.animation__)

////

=== Create an animation representation

After the debug presentation has been defined, we can complete it to add an
animation layer.

==== Create the Animation Layer

* Right click on "Diagram extension MarkedGraph" to __select New Diagram
  Element / Additional Layer__.
* Set its "id" to "Animation".


==== Display the firable transition with a green background color

* Right click on "Animation" to select "New Customization / Style
Customizations".
* Right click on "Style Customizations" to select "New Customization /

==== Add the Animation service

* Right click on "MarkedGraphAnimationViewpoint" to select "New Extension / Java
Extension".
* Set "Qualified Class Name" to
"org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.animation.services.MarkedgraphAnimationServices".
* In the project, __org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.animation__ project, in
"src/org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.animation.services", copy the MarkedgraphDebugServices.java file to MarkedgraphAnimationServices.java, and edit the file to
    - replace AbstractGemocDebuggerServices by AbstractGemocAnimatorServices in
its source code (two times: import and extends)
    - replace "Debug" by "Animation" (two times).

// TODO: The aird has to be provided!

// XXX: Add a link to a tutorial for Sirius Animator.


=== Animate a Model

The executable MarkedGraph Language is now defined with a graphical
visualization.  We can come back to the MarkedGraph Modeling Workbench to run
it.

==== Restart the MarkedGraph Modeling WorkBench

First of all, we need to restart (__File > restart__) the MarkedGraph Modeling
Workbench to take into account the modifications of the MarkedGraph xDSML.

==== Add the MarkedGraphAnimationViewpoint to wikipedia.aird

Right click on wikipedia.aird and select __Viewpoints Selection__.
If __Viewpoints Selection__ is not in the menu, double-click on the file wikipedia.aird.

.Select Viewpoint Selection
image:MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-80-animate-viewpoint-selection.png[Select Viewpoint Selection]

.Select MarkedGraphAnimationViewpoint
image:MarkedGraph/images/v2.1/MG-XDSML-81-animate-viewpoint-selection-set.png[Select MarkedGraphAnimationViewpoint]

You can now open the wikipedia graphical representation (wikipedia.air /
Representation per category / markedgraph / MarkedGraph diagram / wikipedia
MarkedGraph diagram).  On the visualization, all places should be with a yellow
background.

// If it does not work with the "Modeling" perpective, retry with the "Sirius" perspective and then come back to the "Modeling" perspective.


==== Update the "run wikipedia example" configuration

Open the "run wikipedia example" configuration" (__Debug > Debug
Configuration...__).  Complete the "Animator" field with "/org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.sample/wikipedia.aird" (use Browse to select it).

First, we will create a run configuration.  Select "run / run Configurations"

==== Launch the execution of the model

We can now run the "gemoc" configuration (using debug).  It opens the different
views we have already seen but also the graphical visualization on the model.

== Using breakpoints

To be able to debug a model, we need to complete the org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.animation project using the Language Workbench.

The "Debug" layer which has been generated has to be completed and corrected.
A future version of the GEMOC Studio will tackle down the burdon.

=== Complete the org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.animation project

==== Define breakable elements

On the "Mapping Based Decoration Enabled breakpoint" and
"Mapping Based Decoration Disabled breakpoint" of the "Debug" layer, under
"Decorations" element, select the "Place" and "Transition" element.  Change "Position" to "North East".

It indicates that a breakpoint can be enabled or disabled on Place and Transition elements of a MarkedGraph model.  It will be graphically shown as icon displayed in the corresponding graphical element, at the nort east.

In both mappings, change the directory of the icon from
"org.gemoc.executionframework.extensions.sirius" to
"org.gemoc.gemoc_heterogeneous_modeling_workbench.ui".  Do the same change for
the icons of "Operation Action Debug" and "Operation Action Toggle breakpoint".

// TODO: Give a pointer to the file already completed!


=== Correct "Section Debug" in the "Debug" layer

* Change the "External Java Action Debug" of "Operation Action Debug" to "org.gemoc.execution.concurrent.ccsljavaengine.ui.debug.sirius.action.gemocDebugAs".
* Change the "External Java Action Debug" of "Operation Action Debug" to "org.gemoc.execution.concurrent.ccsljavaengine.ui.debug.sirius.action.GemocConcurrentToggleBreakpointAction".


=== Complete MarkedgraphanimationDebugServices.java file

* Edit the file "MarkedgraphanimationDebugServices.java" in "src/org/gemoc/sample/markedgraph/xdsml/animation/services" of the "org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.animation" project to add the folowing method:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public String getModelIdentifier() {
	return org.gemoc.execution.concurrent.ccsljavaengine.ui.Activator.PLUGIN_ID+".debugModel";
}
----

* The file contains an error. To correct it, double-click on "plugin.xml" (or META-INF/MANIFEST.MF), select "dependencies" and add "org.gemoc.execution.concurrent.ccsljavaengine.ui" plug-in.  Save it.


=== Debug the model


* Restart the MarkedGraph Modeling Workbench (__File > restart__ on the second
  eclipse).
* Run the wikipedia example (using __debug > run wikipedia example__).
//  All places and transition have a little white circle at top right (north east) to indicate that the corresponding breakpoint is disabled.
* right click on p3, select __Gemoc > Toogle breakpoint__.  Do the same for t4. Nothing happens (symbols for breakpoints will be updated when running the next step).
* select a logical step.  A green circle has appeared at the top right (north east) for the p3 place and t4 transition.
* select "Resume" to exit step by step mode and run the example
* execution stops on t4 transition and eclipse asks for switching to the Debug perspective.
    We can notice that the breakpoint on p3 has no effect because there is no EF associated on a place.  On the contrary, the execution stopped when EF of the t4 transition was about to fire.



== Going further...

To improve readability of the ECL file and also to favor capitalization and
reuse of MoCC elements, it is possible (and encouraged) to define libraries.
Those libraries looks like the predefined ones that we have already used like
kernel.lib and CCSL.lib.

=== Define a MoCCML library using CCSL

Using the GEMOC Studio, we start by defining a MoCCML project.  In the xDSML
view, we select __Behavioral definition / MoCC definition library__ to create
this new project.

We can then define in this project the following link:MarkedGraph/markedgraph.ccslLib[markedgraph.ccslLib] file. TODO: To be corrected.

[source,ecl]
.The file markedgraph.ccslLib defining a MoCCML library
----
include::MarkedGraph/markedgraph.ccslLib[Definition of a MoCCML library]
----


=== Using it in the ECL file

To use this new library, we only have to import it at the beginning of
the ECL file and the we can use it as kernel.lib and CCSL.lib
libraries.

Here is the new ECL file.

[source,ecl]
.The file MarkedGraphL.ecl using the MoCCML library
----
include::MarkedGraph/markedgraph-library.ecl[Definition of the MoCC using a MoCCML library]

=== Use constraint automata to define Relation


Sometimes, it may be easier to define the MoCC using automata.  For
example, we can see a place as something on which we can read a token
(ont output transition reads one token) or we can write a token (one
input transition writes one token).  A token can only be read if there
is at least one in the place.  Initially, there is as much token in
the place as in the initial token count of the place.

==== Define the constraint automaton using MoCCML editor

For explanations on how to use the MoCCML editor, please refer to the GEMOC
manual.
// TODO: provide the URL to it.

We first define the declaration of a relation (placeReadWrite).  Here after
is its graphical representation.  This relation is parameterized by the r clock (some one how wants to read a token), the w clock (someone how wants to write a token, and n the initial count of token in the place).

.Graphical declaration of the placeReadWriteDef relation
image::MarkedGraph/images/MoCCML-diagram.png[Graphical definition of a relation]

Then we can define this relation. Here after is the resulting automaton. The
local variable count represent the number of tokens in this place.  s0 is the
initial state. The action on the transition from s0 to s initialize count with
n (the parameter).  The two reflexive transitions on s explain what happens
when w or r occurs.  The write transition is fired when w occurs and  a token is assed in the place (count is incremented). The read transition is fired when r occurs.  It removes a token and thus decrements count. 
A guard prevents the read transition to be fired if there is not at liste one token in the place (count >= one).
