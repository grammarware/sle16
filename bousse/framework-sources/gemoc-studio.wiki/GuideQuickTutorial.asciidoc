= GEMOC xDSML tutorial


// name="../../../..//home/svn/SVN/gemoc/trunk/deliverables/WP1/D1.2.1/icons/IconeGemocStudio_48x48x32"

WARNING: This tutorial is a work in progress and is not yet finished.
It still contains TODO and must be polished.


== Introduction

The purpose of this tutorial is to explain on two simple examples with different features, how to
define an eXecutable Domain Specific Modeling Language (xDSML). From an existing DSML definition (abstract and concrete syntaxes), we add the definition of a concurrent semantics with its associated mapping on the abstract syntax.  

The tutorial is structured as follows.  First, we give an overview of
xref:sec-GEMOC-approach[GEMOC approach] to show the focus of our tutorial, then we illustrate on two differents DSMLs the creation of an xDMSL from a DSML definition based on a Ecore metamodel. 

For each example, the first section presents the abstract and the concrete syntaxes of the DSMLs.
After we define the **extended metamodels** to add data and functions relative to the execution features. 
In the next step, we define the **concurrent semantics** of our DSMLs and map this definition to the extended metamodel. At this step the xDSML is created and can be deployed in a modeling workbench.
A first improvement of the **mapping definition** is also presented to enhance the capacity of the relation between the concurrent semantics and the extended metamodel.    



**Conventions used in this tutorial**

Normal text is used to explain the process and  give some rationals
and the proposed solutions.

[[sec-GEMOC-approach]]
== The GEMOC Approach for defining eXecutable DSML


//[[sec-GEMOC-architecture]]

////
NOTE: We consider that the Abstract Syntax (AS) of the DSML is already
defined and thus that its design is not part of the GEMOC xDSML process.
Nevertheless, the process could easily be extended with a new step
which consists in defining the AS and its Concrete Syntaxes (CS).
////

The focus of this tutorial is to describe the Gemoc approach to add execution semantics on an existing DSML definition.
So in our tutorial, the abstract syntax is defined with the Ecore metalanguage and the concrete syntax is a graphical one defined with the Sirius component. To obtain an xDSML we include several definitions to our DSML definition:

* the **DSA** --Domain Specific Actions-- defines the data dedicated to the runtime updates (Execution Data -- ED) and the functions to handle these datas (Execution Functions -- EF). DSA and DSML abstract syntax define the extended sbstract syntax. 

* the **MOCC** (Model of Concurrency and Communication) which includes the mapping definition on the extended abstract syntax and the schedule constraints of the semantics definition. 

* the **DSE** (Domain Specific Event) is a definition to improve the mapping definition between the DSA and MOCC.

* the **animator** which provides views to control and monitor the execution of the models conforming to the xDSML.

The next figure gives an overview of the requested definitions to obtain an xDSML.

During the tutorial we describe these different definitions in a fixed order to illustrate the languages included in the Gemoc studio but all these definitions are all related to, so an iterative approach is often recommended.    

The described examples are based on the xref:sec-MarkedGraph[Marked Graph] DSML and a xref:sec-SigPML[SigPML] DSML.
