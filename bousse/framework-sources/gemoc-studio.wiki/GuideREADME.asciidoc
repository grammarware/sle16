This PressGang wiki is the source of the PressGang Guide document. Or, as we like to call it...

== The _Holy Grail_ of Documentation

This guide covers how to build the PressGang Guide Book written in AsciiDoc using the DocBook toolchain. 

Here are the players:

- AsciiDoc (processed using Asciidoctor)
- Asciidoctor Maven Plugin
- jdocbook
- jdocbook Maven Plugin
- PressGang styles & custom DocBook XSL
- Holy Hand Grenade (ahem, Maven)

The directory layout of the wiki in this example is:

....
├── Guide
│   └── en-US
│       ├── Guide-docinfo.xml
│       ├── Guide.asciidoc
│       ├── GuideExampleChapter.asciidoc
│       ├── GuideREADME.asciidoc
│       ├── GuideSecondExampleChapter.asciidoc
│       └── _Sidebar.asciidoc
├── Home.asciidoc
├── images
│   └── jenkins.png
└── pom.xml
....

The Guide document is based on the AsciiDoc http://asciidoc.org/book.txt[book.txt] example, and a Guide-docinfo.xml include file to support more then one author. The http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] maven plugin converts the asciidoc files into an intermediate Docbook format ('Guide.xml'), which then is used as input for _maven-jdocbook-plugin_ to create HTML and PDF versions.

== Building the Holy Grail

If you want to build these yourself you need to check out the repository locally using:

 git clone git@github.com:pressgang/pressgang-tools.wiki.git

and run:

 mvn clean install

and it will build HTML and PDF versions in the +target/docbook/publish/en-US+ directory.

== Q & A

[qanda]
I spotted a typo, can I fix it?::
Yes please help us maintain the documentation.
Simply update the appropriate page right on https://github.com/pressgang/pressgang-tools/wiki/Guide[GitHub].
Our nightly build will distribute the changes to docbook and the HTML and PDF versions, as specified in the Maven pom.

How do I add an image?::
Images can not be uploaded through the GitHub UI.
Instead you need to add them to the +images+ directory in the root of the pressgang-tools wiki repo and then push it up to GitHub.
You can then reference your image on the page using `image::images/<myimage>.ext`.
+
NOTE: Make sure to add an empty line before and after this image reference.

How do I add numbering and references?::
You should add a label.
We use the convention <type>-<chapter>-<label>.
For example:
+
----
[[figure-gs-screenshot-of-openshift]]
.Welcome screen of OpenShift.
image::website/images/jenkins.png[Screenshot of OpenShift]]
----
+
The label +figure-gs-screenshot-of-openshift+ can be used to link to this figure using `<<figure-gs-screenshot-of-openshift>>`.
The link:GuideExampleChapter[GuideExampleChapter] contains an example.

How do I add a chapter to the book in docbook?::
We add chapters as different files, and then include them in the +Guide.asciidoc+ file.
At docbook generation time it will pull in the chapter into the +Guide.xml+ file.
Also we add a link in the +_Sidebar.asciidoc+ page to have a link when looking at it at Github in wiki style.

Why are all the files prefixed with +Guide+?::
The GitHub wiki flattens out the directory structure on the link:_pages[Pages] page.
In order to group all the files of the Guide together, we decided to prefix them all with +Guide+.
